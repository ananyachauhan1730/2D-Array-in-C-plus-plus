2.Multiplication of Two Matrices

3.Diagonal Addition

4.Transpose of Matrix

5.Comparison of Rows

*ðŸ”´Apparatus / Software Required:*

 VS Cods
 
*ðŸ”´Theory:*

A two-dimensional array (2D array) in C++ is a collection of elements stored in rows and columns, like a table or matrix. It is used to represent mathematical matrices or tabular data.

Matrix operations are fundamental in many areas such as graphics, engineering, data processing, and numerical computations. In C++, we can use nested loops to perform operations like:

1. Matrix Input & Display

Taking values for each row and column using nested loops.

Displaying matrix in matrix form using cout.


2. Matrix Addition

Each element of matrix A is added to the corresponding element of matrix B.

C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]


3. Matrix Multiplication

Row of A is multiplied with column of B:

C[i][j] = sum(A[i][k] * B[k][j])


4. Diagonal Addition

Sum of elements from top-left to bottom-right:

Sum = A[0][0] + A[1][1] + A[2][2] + ...


5. Transpose

Converting rows to columns:

Transpose[i][j] = A[j][i]


6. Comparison of Rows

Element-wise comparison between first and second row:

if(A[0][j] == A[1][j])

*ðŸ”´ Conclusion:ðŸ”´*
In this experiment, we successfully implemented various matrix operations using C++ programming.
We performed matrix input, display, addition, multiplication, diagonal sum, transpose, and row comparison using nested loops and 2D arrays.
 This helped us understand how to use two-dimensional arrays effectively for mathematical and data-based operations.
We also learned the logic behind row-column traversal, element-wise operations, and condition checking in matrices.
The experiment enhanced our logical thinking and improved our C++ programming skills for real-life matrix problems.
